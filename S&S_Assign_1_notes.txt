Since python supports large size integers, so in python gmp need not be used.

All outputs in any program should be in same line with single space between them.

All command line input to any program will be with single spaced

Outputs are only numerics or exact output, eg. Y

for example output for prg 7 could be
Y 3 273 458 745
Sir for Q5, what all do we need to print as intermediate steps?
put comments on all intermediate steps .
intermediate steps you may print the value of phi(n) and  quotient and reminder for exponent x, when expressed in terms of phi(n) , that's all.
But comment that intermediate, if needed I will uncomment it and verify.
Only print final answer.
For Q1 first parameter is n then followed by n elements of the array

- SNS assignment
